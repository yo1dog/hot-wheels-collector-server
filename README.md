The back-end server and web front-end for my Hot Wheels Collector app.

The server provides an API for:

 - Retrieving collections.
 - Adding and removing cars from a collection.
 - Searching for cars by name, toy number, SKU, etc.
 - Finding car by QR code.
 - Adding custom cars.

The server also:

 - Maintains an up-to-date database of cars from Hot Wheels' website.
 - Caches and cleans-up car images by auto-cropping borders.

The font-end website allows the user to:

 - View their collection.
 - Add and remove cars from their collection.
 - Search for cars.

Additional functionality to support the app.
