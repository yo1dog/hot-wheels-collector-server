HotWheels Image Proccesor



Usage:
hwip imagein.png imageout.png alphatolerance (0-253) padding


alphatolerance:
the alpha value a pixel must be greater than
in order to be concidered a forground pixel and contribute to
the bounding box.

0 means only pixels that are 100% invisible are concidered
background pixels.

253 means only pixles that are 100% visible are concidered
forground pixels.

10-15 is usually a good range to account for noise.


padding:
the number of pixels to add to each side of the bounding box.



Build:
make

Requires libpng


NOTE: If you get the error:
error while loading shared libraries: libpng16.so.16: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

and you are running HWIP under CRON, you probably need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable inside the CRON job like so:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libs; /path/to/hwip args args ...
OR
. ~/.bash_profile; /path/to/hwip args args ...
